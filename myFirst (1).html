<h1> Welcome to my first website</h1>
<h2> my name is yourname</h2>
<p>I know EECS1012 is a challenging course, and I need to <strong>engage</strong> really well in problem activitics from first week of calasses for every week.</p>
<p>I have been told that if I treat 1012, 1022, 2030, and 2011 each as a 6-credit course, and really learn the underlying concepts and skills, I will enjoy rest of my CS program. In faet <u>rest of my lifeÔºÅ as long as I am in the CS business. </u>
